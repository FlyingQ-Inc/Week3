# Week3

I had already added the if, else, if else functionality to my resubmit for week 2, with a message that triggers at 4 seconds. I submitted again for the 
change order request assignment. Index.html and code.js are the relevant files for this weeks assignment.

Currently working on login functionality with inputs.I plan to add a sign up form with the aim of using data from that input to populate the "You" div on the RPS.html. I'm still planning on adding blackjack with gambling functionality, and for now I'll add a desired credit limit input with a max of 3 digits.
